## Tic Tac Toe Game
We all have played tic tac toe game, but against a machine? I bet you didn't. This repository was made for a project for the subject Inteligent Control, lectured by Professor FÃ¡bio Meneghetti, and we were challenged to build a tic tac toe game using search trees. I used a JavaScript framework, p5.js, where we can build directly on browser graphical applications. You can check the game by clicking *[here](p5/TicTacToe)*.
